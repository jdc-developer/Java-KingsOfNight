# Java-KingsOfNight
Jogo 2D de plataforma/RPG desenvolvido em Java. Propósito de estudo e aprendizado.

Firstly I would like to give my thanks to these two guys who taught me mostly of what I know about game development, thus I designed this mostly following their methods:

I gave credit on the code, also, for what I made mostly copying their methods.
